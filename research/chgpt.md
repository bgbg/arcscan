1) Was similar work published in the last 10 years?

Yes, but only partially “similar” to Reagan et al. (2016).
	•	Directly inspired by emotional-arc thinking, applied to political discourse: Drăgan’s “The emotional arcs of political narratives” applies an “emotional arc” lens to (very short) political speech segments, using Hedonometer-style scoring, and explicitly discusses limitations around corpus size and emotion coverage.  ￼
	•	Political speeches + emotion measurement, but not “six shapes” arc-clustering per se:
	•	Rheault’s work on emotion in political speech (Canadian House of Commons) shows a key methodological point: transcripts capture sentiment reasonably, but not emotional arousal, motivating multimodal approaches.  ￼
	•	Recent computational political-speech work increasingly uses transformers/LLMs for emotion annotation and classification in parliamentary speech corpora (e.g., Finnish parliament; Hungarian speeches), but this is usually utterance-level emotion classification, not trajectory-shape discovery.  ￼
	•	In diplomacy/political speech, discourse-structure resources (e.g., RST-annotated UNSC speeches) enable segmentation beyond sliding windows, which matters a lot if you want trajectories over rhetorical units.  ￼
	•	Newer work also evaluates multimodal LLMs for measuring emotional arousal in political speech recordings, again emphasizing the gap between text-only valence and performed emotion.  ￼

Bottom line: there is precedent for (a) emotion dynamics in political speech and (b) arc/trajectory framing, but (c) systematic discovery of a small set of recurring “arc shapes” via unsupervised clustering at scale—in the specific spirit of Reagan et al.’s pipeline (time series + decomposition + clustering)—appears much less common in political-speech NLP, and is a credible gap to target.  ￼

2) Draft Introduction (for your paper)

Political speeches are among the most consequential forms of public language: they justify policy, signal identity, coordinate coalitions, and attempt to move audiences emotionally. The last decade has seen rapid growth in computational approaches to political text and speech, driven by the digitization of parliamentary proceedings, campaign transcripts, and broadcast archives, alongside advances in neural language models. Yet a persistent mismatch remains between what is easy to measure at scale and what political communication theory often foregrounds. Many NLP pipelines treat speeches as “bags of sentences” (or single documents) and output aggregate labels such as topic, ideology, sentiment, or discrete emotions. These outputs are valuable, but they can miss a central property of persuasive communication: speeches unfold over time. The ordering of affective and rhetorical moves—how a speaker “sets a mood,” escalates conflict, resolves tension, or ends with uplift—may be as important as the average emotional tone.

A growing body of work has focused on automatically measuring emotion in political language, particularly in parliamentary contexts. Recent studies use transformers and LLMs to annotate and classify emotions in legislative speech corpora, demonstrating both the promise of modern models and the practical challenges of obtaining reliable labels (including annotator disagreement and domain shift between everyday language and parliamentary discourse).  ￼ At the same time, political methodologists have emphasized an important limitation: text transcripts often capture sentiment (valence) better than emotional arousal, because arousal is expressed through vocal delivery, facial expression, and other nonverbal cues. This motivates multimodal measurement when the research question concerns intensity rather than polarity.  ￼ These findings suggest that “emotion in speeches” is not a single construct: valence, arousal, discrete emotions, and performance may each require different operationalizations.

In parallel, narrative analysis in computational social science has proposed that many long-form texts can be characterized by a small number of recurring emotional trajectories. Reagan et al. operationalized an “emotional arc” as a sentiment time series obtained by sliding a fixed-length window through a text, and used multiple unsupervised and decomposition methods (including SVD and clustering) to identify a small set of core arc patterns in fictional narratives.  ￼ While the narrative domain differs from political speech, the underlying methodological idea is portable: represent each speech as a standardized emotional trajectory and apply unsupervised learning to discover recurrent shapes. Early political applications inspired by this framing exist, but they have typically been limited in scope or constrained by short text length and narrow emotion measures.  ￼ This leaves open whether large collections of political speeches—across speakers, offices, genres (parliamentary, campaign rallies, crisis addresses), and languages—exhibit a compact “basis set” of affective trajectories analogous to those proposed for stories.

This paper proposes a trajectory-first approach to political-speech emotion. Instead of treating each speech as a single point estimate, we model it as a sequence: an affective signal over ordered units (sentences, paragraphs, or discourse segments). The choice of segmentation is not merely technical; it shapes what “movement” means. Recent resources in discourse analysis of political/diplomatic speech (e.g., RST-annotated corpora) highlight that rhetorical units can be systematically identified and may provide a theoretically grounded axis for tracking progression (problem framing → evidence → attribution → call to action), beyond uniform sliding windows.  ￼ With trajectories in hand, we can apply time-series clustering and representation learning to identify prototypical shapes and quantify how frequently each shape appears within and across political contexts.

A trajectory perspective enables several still-open research questions in political NLP and political communication. First, do political speeches cluster into a small number of recurrent affective shapes, and if so, are these shapes stable across languages, institutions, and media (parliament vs. rallies vs. televised addresses)? Second, what is the relationship between affective shapes and rhetorical structure: do certain arc types co-occur with specific discourse relations (e.g., elaboration vs. concession) or conflict markers, and can discourse-aware segmentation improve the interpretability of discovered clusters?  ￼ Third, how robust are these shapes to measurement choices—lexicon vs. transformer-based emotion scoring, valence vs. discrete emotions, and text-only vs. multimodal signals? Prior evidence that transcripts under-represent arousal implies that some “shapes” may be artifacts of text-only valence tracking, while others may generalize to performed emotion when audio-visual features are included.  ￼ Fourth, do certain shapes predict outcomes such as audience response, media uptake, or downstream political behavior, and are such associations speaker-specific or context-specific?

By addressing these questions, the paper aims to contribute both methodologically and substantively. Methodologically, it connects emotional-arc discovery tools from narrative analytics to modern political-speech NLP, emphasizing standardized trajectory representations and unsupervised shape discovery.  ￼ Substantively, it offers a new lens on how political actors structure affect over the course of a speech, complementing topic, framing, and stance analyses with a temporally explicit account of emotional progression. The result is a framework for comparing speeches not only by what they say, but by how their emotional dynamics evolve—and for testing whether political persuasion relies on a small repertoire of reusable affective “shapes,” or whether it is more contextually idiosyncratic than narrative theory would predict.

If you want, I can also propose (a) 2–3 alternative segmentation schemes (sentence/paragraph/discourse-EDU) and (b) a minimal “Methods” outline that mirrors Reagan et al. (time-series construction → normalization → decomposition/clustering → validation).
