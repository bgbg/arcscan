The Geometry of Rhetoric: A Diachronic and Computational Analysis of Emotional Arcs in Political Discourse1. Executive SummaryThe digitization of political discourse, coupled with advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), has precipitated a "computational turn" in the humanities and social sciences. Where political analysis once relied on qualitative close reading or static aggregate statistics, researchers are now mapping the dynamic topology of rhetoric—the "shape" of a speech as it unfolds in time. This report exhaustively investigates the viability, existing literature, and methodological requirements for applying the "six basic shapes" of narrative emotional arcs—originally identified in fiction by Reagan et al. (2016)—to the domain of political speeches.The core premise of this inquiry is derived from the observation that human cognition is fundamentally narrative. We process information not as isolated logic gates but as stories with beginnings, middles, and ends. Reagan et al. (2016) empirically validated Kurt Vonnegut's hypothesis that these stories follow a limited set of emotional trajectories: Rags to Riches (Rise), Tragedy (Fall), Man in a Hole (Fall-Rise), Icarus (Rise-Fall), Cinderella (Rise-Fall-Rise), and Oedipus (Fall-Rise-Fall).1This report provides a definitive answer to the user's query regarding similar analyses published in the last decade. We confirm that while no single study has exhaustively categorized a massive corpus of political speeches into these exact six bins with the scale of Reagan’s literary analysis, significant parallel and precursor work exists. Notably, Drăgan (2020, 2021) directly applied Reagan’s model to political debates, establishing the importance of multimodal analysis. Boyd et al. (2020) developed a "narrative arc" framework focusing on structural tension rather than pure valence. Most recently, the release of domain-specific language models like RooseBERT (2025) and tools like PoliPulse CA (2025) marks a maturation of the field, enabling the nuanced detection of rhetorical strategies that standard sentiment lexicons miss.The following document is structured to serve as both a comprehensive literature review and a methodological handbook. It synthesizes findings from computational linguistics, political psychology, and data science to demonstrate that political speeches do indeed possess distinct "shapes," though these shapes are often deformations of the fictional archetypes—skewed by the necessities of incumbency, the aggression of modern populism, and the structural constraints of the medium. The report concludes with a fully drafted, academically rigorous introduction for a proposed paper that would bridge the identified gaps by applying this narrative geometry to a large-scale political corpus.2. Theoretical Foundations: The Geometry of NarrativeTo rigorously apply the concept of "emotional arcs" to political speech, one must first deconstruct the theoretical and mathematical frameworks that underpin the "six shapes" hypothesis. This section explores the genealogy of the concept, tracing it from literary theory to complex system science.2.1 The Vonnegut Hypothesis and the Quantified Self of StoriesThe intellectual lineage of this analysis traces back to the American writer Kurt Vonnegut, who, in his rejected master’s thesis in anthropology, proposed that stories have shapes which can be graphed on a simple coordinate system. Vonnegut argued that despite the infinite variety of details in storytelling, the underlying emotional structures are finite and repetitive. He envisioned a graph defined by two axes: the "B-E axis" (Beginning to End, representing the time of the narrative) and the "G-I axis" (Good fortune to Ill fortune, representing the emotional state of the protagonist).1Vonnegut’s theory remained largely anecdotal until the advent of "Big Data" approaches to literature. In 2016, researchers at the Computational Story Lab at the University of Vermont—Andrew J. Reagan, Lewis Mitchell, Dilan Kiley, Christopher M. Danforth, and Peter Sheridan Dodds—sought to test this hypothesis empirically. Their seminal paper, "The emotional arcs of stories are dominated by six basic shapes," utilized a dataset of 1,327 stories from Project Gutenberg to generate "emotional trajectories".22.1.1 The Six ArchetypesReagan et al. (2016) utilized a windowed sentiment analysis approach (using the Hedonometer lexicon) and singular value decomposition (SVD) to reduce the complexity of these 1,327 arcs. They identified that the emotional arcs of these stories were dominated by six basic shapes, which they mapped to Vonnegut’s proposed curves 2:Arc NameTrajectoryNarrative DynamicPotential Political AnalogRags to RichesRise ($\nearrow$)Continuous improvement in fortune.The Visionary Arc: "Our best days are ahead." Common in acceptance speeches and movements of hope (e.g., Obama 2008).TragedyFall ($\searrow$)Continuous decline in fortune.The Warning Arc: "The nation is dying." Rare as a standalone, usually part of a larger "Man in a Hole" structure (e.g., "American Carnage").Man in a HoleFall-Rise ($\searrow \nearrow$)The protagonist encounters trouble but overcomes it.The Crisis-Response Arc: "We faced a recession/war (Fall), but my policies fixed it (Rise)." The standard arc of incumbency.IcarusRise-Fall ($\nearrow \searrow$)A temporary rise followed by a catastrophic fall.The Cautionary Tale: Often used in negative campaigning to describe an opponent's trajectory or a failed policy.CinderellaRise-Fall-Rise ($\nearrow \searrow \nearrow$)Initial success, a setback, and ultimate triumph.The Resilience Arc: "We built this nation (Rise), enemies threatened it (Fall), but we will rebuild (Rise)."OedipusFall-Rise-Fall ($\searrow \nearrow \searrow$)A tragedy that involves a brief moment of hope.Dystopian Projection: A rhetorical device describing a failed state to induce fear.The mathematical robustness of these findings was confirmed through three independent methods: matrix decomposition by SVD, supervised learning by agglomerative (hierarchical) clustering with Ward’s method, and unsupervised learning by a Self Organizing Map (SOM).7 This triangulation suggests that these shapes are not artifacts of a specific algorithm but genuine topological features of the Western narrative corpus.2.2 Narrative Transportation: The Mechanism of PersuasionWhy should a political analyst care about the "shape" of a speech? The utility of identifying these arcs lies in the psychological concept of narrative transportation. As noted by Nabi and Green (2015) and substantiated in recent reviews, audiences who are "swept up" or "transported" into a story become more susceptible to persuasion and less likely to generate counter-arguments.9The emotional shifts—the ups and downs of the arc—act as the "motors" for this persuasion. A flat emotional line, regardless of how positive, is less engaging than a dynamic trajectory. In political psychology, the Man in a Hole arc is particularly potent because it aligns with the "Threat-Relief" strategy. By inducing anxiety (the Fall) to heighten physiological arousal and attention, and then offering a political solution (the Rise) to generate relief, the politician creates a binding emotional event. Drăgan (2020) emphasizes that political actors prefer narrative structures because they "always say more than they say," stimulating the audience to search for meaning rather than just processing logical arguments.1 Thus, the "shape" of the speech is not merely aesthetic; it is a functional tool of cognitive control and ideological alignment.2.3 Structural vs. Emotional NarratologyA critical theoretical distinction that emerged in the literature between 2016 and 2025 is the difference between plot structure and emotional arc.Plot refers to the mechanics of the narrative (e.g., the specific policy proposals, the names of opponents, the historical dates).Emotional Arc refers to the valence of the experience evoked in the listener (e.g., the feeling of hope, fear, or indignation).1Reagan et al. (2016) and subsequent commentators like Boyd et al. (2020) argue that while plot is complex and highly variable, the emotional experience is simpler and more universal.1 For political speeches, this distinction is vital. A politician may describe a complex policy plot (tax codes, border regulations), but the emotional arc serves a simpler function: to move the audience from a state of insecurity to a state of security.Boyd et al. (2020) further refined this by analyzing "narrative arcs" through structural pacing rather than just sentiment. They identified three key dimensions:Staging: The establishment of context (who, where, when), marked by high usage of prepositions and articles.11Plot Progression: The momentum of the story.Cognitive Tension: The complexity and conflict within the text.They found that successful narratives (those that resonate) often exhibit high staging (setting the scene) followed by rising cognitive tension, adhering to a "pyramid" structure similar to Freytag’s model.11 This suggests that a political speech must not only "feel" right (Emotional Arc) but "flow" right (Narrative Structure).3. Literature Review: Similar Analyses (2015–2025)The user asks: Was a similar analysis published in the last 10 years? The answer is a definitive yes, though with varying degrees of fidelity to the specific "six shapes" model. The field has evolved from applying general sentiment analysis to political texts towards specifically seeking these Reagan-esque arcs in political rhetoric. We can categorize the relevant literature into three distinct waves.3.1 Wave 1: The Direct Application (Drăgan, 2019-2021)The most direct and explicit attempt to apply Reagan et al.’s "six shapes" to political discourse is found in the work of Nicolae-Sorin Drăgan, specifically in his papers "The emotional arcs of political narratives" (2021) and "Faces of Fear in Political Discourse".1Drăgan explicitly aimed to test the Reagan model in the context of political communication. His work is critical because it bridges the gap between the "Big Data" approach of the Vermont team and the qualitative nuance of political semiotics.Methodology: Drăgan utilized the Hedonometer, the same lexicon-based tool used by Reagan et al., to generate emotional scores for text segments. He adopted the "windowing" technique to smooth the data, creating a readable arc from the transcript.The Multimodal Innovation: Recognizing that a political speech is a performance, Drăgan argued that text alone is insufficient. He introduced a multimodal analysis, correlating the text-based emotional arc with "semiotic resources" such as gestures. He categorized gestures into families, such as deictic (pointing, used to draw attention to achievements) and ring/precision (R-family, used to convey conviction and invite agreement).1Case Study: The analysis focused on the final 2009 Romanian presidential debate between Traian Băsescu and Mircea Geoană. While the corpus was small (a 320-word fragment, which Drăgan acknowledges as a limitation given the Hedonometer’s preference for 10,000+ words), the study provided a proof-of-concept.1Findings: Drăgan concluded that political narratives do indeed follow emotional profiles similar to Vonnegut’s shapes. However, he found that the true arc is a composite of the verbal and the visual. A "rise" in verbal sentiment might be amplified or contradicted by the speaker's physical demeanor (e.g., a smile vs. a frown). This suggests that any purely text-based analysis of political speech (like the one the user proposes) must acknowledge the "missing variable" of performance.13.2 Wave 2: Structural and Fractal Approaches (Boyd, Bizzoni, 2020-2022)While Drăgan focused on emotion, a parallel stream of research focused on the structure of the arc. Boyd et al. (2020) published a seminal paper in Science Advances titled "The narrative arc: Revealing core narrative structures through text analysis".10Divergence from Reagan: Instead of focusing solely on valence (happy/sad), Boyd et al. analyzed the structural components of stories. They utilized LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) to track the density of "staging" words (prepositions) and "cognitive tension" words (cognitive processes).Application to Non-Fiction: Crucially, Boyd et al. applied this framework to non-fiction texts, including legal opinions, TED talks, and political speeches.16Findings: They found that successful narratives adhere to a universal "pyramid" structure of low tension $\rightarrow$ high tension $\rightarrow$ resolution. This validates the idea that political speeches, to be successful, must follow a structural arc akin to storytelling.Fractality: Related research by Bizzoni et al. (2022) and Hu et al. (2021) examined the fractality (Hurst exponent) of sentiment arcs.18 They hypothesized that high-quality narratives have a specific "jaggedness" or self-similarity—they are not perfectly smooth, nor are they random noise. This "sweet spot" of fractality was found to correlate with reader appreciation in fairy tales, and researchers suggest it likely correlates with voter engagement in political blogs and speeches.203.3 Wave 3: The Transformer Revolution (2024-2025)The most recent wave of research has moved away from lexicon-based tools (like Hedonometer) toward Transformer-based models, acknowledging that political sentiment is highly context-dependent and often relies on sarcasm, irony, or "dog whistles" that dictionaries miss.3.3.1 RooseBERT (2025)Dore et al. (2025) introduced RooseBERT, a language model specifically pre-trained on political debates and speeches (including US Presidential debates and UN General Assembly speeches).21The Problem with General Models: Standard models (like BERT) often fail to capture the rhetorical complexity of debates. For example, "I love how the Senator voted for that bill" could be dripping with sarcasm, which a standard model might score as positive.The Solution: RooseBERT was trained on 8,000 debates to handle "turn-taking, rebuttals, and rhetorical complexity".22Relevance: While the primary paper focuses on tasks like argument mining 25, the underlying architecture allows for the generation of far more accurate "emotional trajectories" than lexicon approaches. The authors explicitly position this as a tool to analyze "persuasive framing."3.3.2 PoliPulse CA (2025)In a master's thesis and associated tool release, Jost (2025) developed PoliPulse CA, a tool investigating long-term trends in US State of the Union addresses (1934–2025).26Methodology: This study combined rule-based methods (VADER) with a fine-tuned DistilBERT model.Findings: Jost identified a statistically significant trend toward "aggressive political rhetoric" (Spearman $\rho =.501$). This suggests a flattening or skewing of the traditional "positive" arcs (Rags to Riches) toward more conflict-heavy arcs (Man in a Hole or Tragedy) in modern discourse. This directly addresses the user's interest in identifying "common shapes" in political speech—the common shape is becoming increasingly jagged and aggressive.263.4 Summary of Gap AnalysisDespite this activity, a specific gap remains:Scale: Drăgan’s work was N=1. Reagan’s was N=1,327 (fiction). There is no N>1,000 study clustering political speeches into Reagan’s six archetypes using modern Transformers.Tool Bias: Most "arc" studies still use lexicons (Hedonometer). Most "Transformer" studies focus on classification, not arc typology.The "W" Shape: Studies of Shark Tank pitches 28 suggest that persuasive speech might follow a "W" shape (Rise-Fall-Rise-Fall-Rise), which is a high-frequency oscillation not fully captured by Reagan’s smoothed arcs.4. Methodological Architectures for Political Arc MiningIf one were to conduct the analysis proposed by the user, the methodology would need to be robust enough to handle the specific idiosyncrasies of political text (length variation, context dependence, and noise). Based on the review of the "State of the Art" reports 29, the following methodological architecture is recommended.4.1 Data Processing and Sentiment Extraction4.1.1 The Tokenization ProblemPolitical speeches vary wildly in length. A nomination acceptance speech might be 4,000 words; a YouTube campaign update might be 300 words. Reagan et al. used a "sliding window" of 10,000 words for novels.12 This is impossible for speeches.Solution: The "adaptive window" or "sentence-level" scoring. Recent work suggests breaking the text into sentences or paragraphs, scoring each, and then interpolating to a fixed number of points (e.g., 100 points per speech) to normalize the x-axis.314.1.2 Dictionary vs. TransformerDictionary Approach (Hedonometer/LIWC): Fast, transparent, and used by Reagan. However, it fails on negation ("I am not a crook").Transformer Approach (RooseBERT/BERT): Context-aware. It creates an embedding for the sentence and predicts valence.Recommendation: The literature suggests a hybrid approach or a fine-tuned Transformer (like RooseBERT) is now the gold standard for accuracy.21 However, for "long-range" arc detection, the noise of individual sentence scoring must be smoothed.4.2 Time Series ClusteringOnce the speeches are converted into sentiment time series (e.g., a vector of 100 values), they must be clustered to find the "shapes."4.2.1 Dimensionality Reduction (SVD)Reagan et al. used Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). SVD decomposes the matrix of all arcs into "eigen-moods"—the fundamental basis shapes that can be combined to recreate any specific arc.Relevance: SVD is excellent for finding the "building blocks" (e.g., a linear rise, a quadratic fall).4.2.2 Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)A major limitation identified in the snippets is that simple Euclidean distance matching fails if the "events" happen at different times.Scenario: Speech A has a crisis (Fall) at minute 2. Speech B has a crisis (Fall) at minute 10. Euclidean distance says these are different.Solution: Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) allows the algorithm to "warp" the time axis to align the peaks and troughs.32 This is critical for political speeches where the preamble length varies. The use of DTW with k-means or k-medoids clustering is the current state-of-the-art for narrative alignment.334.3 Validation and CorrelationTo answer "so what?", the arcs must be correlated with metadata.Election Outcome: Do "Man in a Hole" speeches correlate with winning?Polling Bumps: Does a "Rags to Riches" speech generate a convention bounce?Fractality (Hurst Exponent): As suggested by Bizzoni et al. (2022), calculating the Hurst exponent of the arc can reveal the "predictability" of the rhetoric. High fractality might indicate a chaotic, populist style; low fractality might indicate a technocratic, establishment style.185. Synthesizing the Shapes of PowerBased on the synthesis of the gathered research, we can hypothesize how Reagan’s six shapes manifest in the political domain. This section generates "second-order insights" by connecting the literary shapes to political strategy.5.1 The Incumbent's Dilemma: Man in a HoleThe Man in a Hole arc (Fall-Rise) is likely the dominant shape for incumbents seeking re-election.Mechanism: The incumbent cannot promise "Rags to Riches" because they have been in charge for four years; if things are "Rags," it’s their fault.Strategy: Instead, they must frame the term as a series of exogenous shocks (The Fall—e.g., a pandemic, a war, an economic crash) which were successfully navigated by their leadership (The Rise). The narrative is not "Paradise Achieved" but "Disaster Averted."Evidence: This aligns with the "Threat-Relief" psychological model.355.2 The Challenger's Promise: Rags to RichesThe Rags to Riches arc (Rise) is the domain of the "Change" candidate.Mechanism: The narrative starts at a baseline of "current dissatisfaction" (implicit Rags) and projects a linear trajectory into a utopian future.Political Analog: The "Visionary" speech. Note that in Reagan’s fiction analysis, Rags to Riches was less popular than Oedipus or Man in a Hole.36 In politics, however, it is a staple of campaign announcements.5.3 The Weaponization of Tragedy and OedipusPure Tragedy (Fall) is narrative suicide in fiction (who wants to read a book where everyone just gets sadder?). In politics, it is used exclusively as a weapon—the Attack Ad.Mechanism: The "Icarus" or "Oedipus" arc is applied to the opponent. "He rose to power (Rise), but his corruption destroyed our city (Fall)."Insight: We should expect to find that negative arcs are almost always third-person narratives (about the opponent), while positive arcs are first-person or collective narratives ("We shall rise").5.4 The "W" Shape and Cognitive EngagementThe snippets regarding Shark Tank 28 and "Cognitive Tension" 11 suggest that high-stakes persuasion requires keeping the audience on edge. A simple "Rise" can be boring. A "W" shape (a series of problems and solutions) mimics the structure of a complex policy debate or a town hall.Prediction: The most viral political clips likely correspond to the "troughs" (the moments of high tension/conflict) within a larger "W" arc.6. Introduction to the Proposed Academic PaperThe following is a draft introduction for the academic paper the user intends to write. It is written in a formal, academic style, adhering to the conventions of journals in Computational Social Science (e.g., EPJ Data Science, Journal of Communication, or POETICS).Title: The Geometry of Persuasion: Mapping the Six Emotional Arcs in Modern Political Discourse1. Introduction"The human mind is a story processor, not a logic processor" (Haidt, 2012). In the high-stakes arena of political communication, the efficacy of a speech is rarely determined solely by the validity of its arguments or the granularity of its policy proposals. Rather, it is the narrative vessel—the emotional journey upon which the speaker guides the audience—that dictates resonance, persuasion, and ultimately, electoral success. While political analysts have long scrutinized the static sentiment of speeches (is the candidate angry? is the tone hopeful?), a growing body of evidence suggests that the dynamic trajectory of emotion—the "emotional arc"—is the more fundamental unit of narrative cognition (Boyd et al., 2020; Reagan et al., 2016).The concept that stories follow a finite set of structural patterns is not new. From Aristotle’s Poetics to Freytag’s Pyramid, scholars have sought to map the rise and fall of dramatic action. However, it was Vonnegut (1995) who proposed that these shapes could be graphed on a simple axis of fortune, and Reagan et al. (2016) who empirically validated this hypothesis. Analyzing over 1,300 works of fiction, Reagan et al. demonstrated that the emotional landscape of literature is dominated by six basic shapes: Rags to riches (rise), Tragedy (fall), Man in a hole (fall-rise), Icarus (rise-fall), Cinderella (rise-fall-rise), and Oedipus (fall-rise-fall).The applicability of these "fiction-derived" shapes to the domain of political rhetoric remains an open and compelling question. Political speeches are, in essence, non-fiction narratives constructed to persuade. They possess a beginning, where the speaker establishes a relationship with the audience; a middle, often characterized by the identification of conflict or crisis; and an end, typically resolving in a call to action or a vision of the future. If narratives are the primary cognitive structure for human sense-making, it follows that successful political speeches likely conform to the same emotional topologies that have captivated human audiences for millennia.2. The Gap in Current ResearchWhile recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have enabled the large-scale analysis of political text, the focus has largely remained on discrete classification tasks such as stance detection, topic modeling, or aggregate sentiment scoring (Dore et al., 2025; Jost, 2025). Studies that do examine temporal dynamics often focus on structural cohesion rather than emotional topology (Boyd et al., 2020) or are limited to small-scale qualitative case studies (Drăgan, 2021).For instance, Drăgan (2021) successfully applied Reagan’s model to a single presidential debate, highlighting the multimodal nature of political emotion but lacking the statistical power of a large corpus. Conversely, large-scale studies of congressional speeches (e.g., examining 138 years of data) have tracked the linear evolution of positivity over decades but have not categorized individual speeches by their internal emotional geometry (Gentzkow et al., 2019). There exists no systematic taxonomy of political speeches based on the "six basic shapes," nor an empirical evaluation of which shapes correlate with political victory.Furthermore, the tools traditionally employed for this analysis—lexicon-based sentiment dictionaries like the Hedonometer—struggle with the unique rhetorical devices of politics, such as sarcasm, dog-whistles, and negation (e.g., "I am not saying my opponent is a crook"). The emergence of domain-specific language models, such as RooseBERT (Dore et al., 2025), offers a new opportunity to extract high-fidelity emotional signals from political text, allowing for a rigorous re-examination of the "narrative arc" hypothesis in a political context.3. Research Objectives and ContributionsThis study aims to bridge the gap between computational narratology and political science by applying the "six basic shapes" framework to a comprehensive corpus of political speeches. We posit that political speeches, like novels, cluster into distinct emotional archetypes, and that the choice of archetype is not random but strategic.Specifically, this paper addresses the following research questions:Existence: Do the emotional arcs of political speeches cluster into the six basic shapes identified by Reagan et al. (2016) in fiction?Distribution: How does the distribution of these shapes differ between political contexts (e.g., campaign announcements vs. concession speeches) and political ideologies?Correlation: Is there a correlation between specific emotional arcs (e.g., Man in a Hole vs. Tragedy) and the perceived success of the speech (measured by polling bumps or election outcomes)?Methodologically, this paper advances the state of the art by replacing the static lexicon approaches of previous decades with a Transformer-based sentiment extraction pipeline (utilizing RooseBERT), followed by Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to cluster speeches of varying lengths based on their shape similarity. In doing so, this research moves beyond asking what politicians say to revealing how they structure the emotional journey of the electorate. It proposes a "Geometry of Persuasion," providing a quantitative framework to understand the narrative strategies that define modern democracy.7. ConclusionThis report has synthesized a decade of research at the intersection of computational linguistics and political science to answer the user's query. We have established that while the specific "six shapes" analysis has not been applied to political speeches at scale, the methodological components—multimodal analysis (Drăgan), structural arc modeling (Boyd), and domain-specific Transformers (Dore/Jost)—are now available to make such a study feasible and rigorous.The investigation reveals that the "emotional arc" is a robust psychological mechanism for persuasion, leveraging narrative transportation to bypass critical resistance. By applying the "six shapes" taxonomy, researchers can move beyond the "what" of political speech (topics, keywords) to the "how" (the emotional trajectory). The proposed academic paper, outlined in Section 6, stands on the shoulders of these giants, poised to contribute a novel "Geometry of Persuasion" to the field.Table 1: Comparative Analysis of Key Methodologies (2016–2025)Study/AuthorContextMethodologyKey Contribution to "Shapes"LimitationsReagan et al.
